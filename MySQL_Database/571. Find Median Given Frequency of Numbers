Problem:

The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

+--------+
| median |
+--------|
| 0.0000 |
+--------+
Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.


Solution:

1. We get the accumulative sum of frequency for each number in both ascendent and descdent order first.
2. The key to get the median is to find out the number or two numbers whoes accumulative sum of frequency is(are) greater or equal to total SUM(Frequency)/2.


SELECT AVG(Number) AS median
FROM
   (
    SELECT *,
           SUM(Frequency) OVER(ORDER BY Number) AS cum_sum_asc,
           SUM(Frequency) OVER(ORDER BY Number DESC) AS cum_sum_des,
           SUM(Frequency) OVER () AS total_ct
      FROM Numbers
        ) temp
WHERE cum_sum_asc >= total_ct / 2
      AND cum_sum_des >=total_ct/2
